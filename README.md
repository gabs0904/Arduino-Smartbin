# Arduino Smartbin


**SmartBin** (a.k.a. *Ziggy*) is an **Arduino-powered smart trashcan** designed to revolutionize waste management by combining technology with convenience. Built with precision, Ziggy ensures **touch-free interactions**, **real-time fill-level monitoring**, and a **designated smoking compartment** triggered by sound.  



##  Features  

- **Touch-Free Lid Opening**  
   Ziggy’s ultrasonic sensor detects when you approach and automatically opens the lid using servo motors—no touching required!  
   
- **Fill-Level Monitoring**  
   Equipped with an ultrasonic sensor, Ziggy keeps track of its fill level and lets you know when it’s time to take out the trash.  

- **Smoking Compartment**  
   Ziggy features a discreet smoking compartment, triggered by specific sound cues (like clapping), for proper disposal of cigarette butts.

##  Technologies Used  

- **Arduino UNO R3**: The brain of Ziggy that handles all the sensors and actuators.  
- **Servo Motors**: For precise lid and compartment movement.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: To measure distance and monitor trash levels.  
- **Sound Sensor**: Detects audio cues to trigger the smoking compartment.  


##  Setup & Build Instructions  

### Hardware Needed:  
- 1x **Arduino UNO R3**  
- 1x **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**  
- 2x **Servo Motors**  
- 1x **Sound Sensor**  
- 1x **Trashcan (for mounting components)**  
- Jumper wires, breadboard, and a power source  

### Steps:  

1. **Build the Circuit**  
   - Wire the components as shown in the circuit diagram (provided in this repository).  
2. **Upload the Code**  
   - Use the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino board.  
3. **Assemble the Bin**  
   - Attach the sensors and motors to your trashcan using hot glue or screws.  
4. **Power It Up**  
   - Connect your Arduino to a power source, and Ziggy will spring to life!
