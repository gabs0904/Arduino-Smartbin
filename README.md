SmartBin (also called Ziggy) is an Arduino-powered smart trashcan designed to make waste management cleaner, more efficient, and more fun! By combining servo motors, ultrasonic sensors, and sound detection, Ziggy offers the following innovative features:

Touch-Free Lid Opening: No need to touch the lidâ€”just come close, and Ziggy will open up for you.
Fill-Level Monitoring: With its ultrasonic sensor, Ziggy knows when it's full and can alert you. Say goodbye to overflowing trashcans!
Smoking Compartment: A discreet smoking compartment opens when Ziggy hears specific sound cues (like a clap), offering a tidy way to dispose of cigarette butts.
Features and Technologies:
Built using Arduino UNO R3 as the microcontroller.
Servo motors automate lid and compartment movements.
Ultrasonic sensor measures the fill level and ensures Ziggy is always aware of its capacity.
Sound sensor triggers actions based on sound patterns.
